I will begin with some rules, so I know what I am doing:
1. These parameters are revisable.
2. Publish something every month while I am studying at Hack Reactor (starting pre-course on 10/6/20).
3. Explore software engineering as representation, and write about it.
4. Draw a rabbit every week (starting with this dog).
